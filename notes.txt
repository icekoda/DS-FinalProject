===Final Project Notes===

Abstract:

	1. Create a barcode to present each image.
	2. Use the barcode of the image to search for the most similar image in the
	   dataset.
	3. Conduct an experiment to report the retrieval accuracy.

Required Algorithms:

	1. Barcode_Generator
	2. Search_Algorithm

Objectives:

	1. Convert Image to an Array
---:		a. Convert a single image to an array
		b. Create function that can cycle through all images and create
		   an array for each
	2. Convert Array to Barcode
	3. Allow reverse order
